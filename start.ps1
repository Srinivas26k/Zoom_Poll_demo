<#
.SYNOPSIS
Starts the Zoom Poll Automator application by running the setup.py script.
Sets up the virtual environment and then executes setup.py for the main setup logic.
.DESCRIPTION
This script performs the following steps:
1. Checks for Python 3.8+ in the system's PATH.
2. Creates a Python virtual environment if it doesn't exist.
3. Activates the virtual environment.
4. Installs/upgrades pip and installs 'rich' and 'setuptools' in the venv
   so that setup.py can run correctly with rich output.
5. Executes the setup.py script within the activated virtual environment.
6. Launches the main application script (app.py) if setup.py was successful.
7. Deactivates the virtual environment upon script completion.
.NOTES
Requires PowerShell 5.1 or later (standard on modern Windows).
Requires Python 3.8+ installed.
The main setup logic and rich formatting are handled by the setup.py script.
